;; Agents (notably Claude Code) call readdir() on every ancestor of the working
;; directory during startup. If only file-read-metadata (stat) is granted, the
;; agent cannot list directory contents, which causes it to blank PATH and break.
;; Using 'literal' (not 'subpath') keeps this safe: it grants read access to the
;; directory entry itself (i.e. listing its immediate children), but does NOT
;; grant recursive read access to files or subdirectories under it.
