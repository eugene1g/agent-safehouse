Summary:
  Agent Safehouse is a macOS sandbox toolkit for coding agents and CLIs.
  It composes a deny-by-default sandbox-exec policy with scoped allows.

How to use this CLI:
  1) Policy mode (no command):
     Generates a policy file and prints the filename.
     Use --stdout to print the policy text instead.
     You can pass that file to your own sandbox-exec invocation.
  2) Execute mode (command provided):
     Generates a policy and runs the command inside that policy.

Common examples:
  # Generate policy file path
  $(basename "$0")

  # Print policy text to stdout
  $(basename "$0") --stdout

  # Generate policy path and run your own sandbox-exec command
  sandbox-exec -f "\$($(basename "$0"))" -- /usr/bin/true

  # Run a command under Safehouse policy
  $(basename "$0") -- claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
  $(basename "$0") --enable=docker -- docker ps

Policy scope options:
  --enable FEATURES
  --enable=FEATURES
      Comma-separated optional features to enable
      Supported values: docker, macos-gui, electron
      Note: electron implies macos-gui
      Browser native messaging is always on (not toggleable)

  --add-dirs-ro PATHS
  --add-dirs-ro=PATHS
      Colon-separated paths to grant read-only access

  --add-dirs PATHS
  --add-dirs=PATHS
      Colon-separated paths to grant read/write access

  --workdir DIR
  --workdir=DIR
      Main directory to grant read/write access
      Empty string disables automatic workdir grants

  --append-profile PATH
  --append-profile=PATH
      Append an additional sandbox profile file after generated rules
      Repeatable; files are appended in argument order

  --output PATH
  --output=PATH
      Write policy to a specific file path

Output options:
  --stdout
      Print policy text to stdout (do not execute command)

General:
  -h, --help
      Show this help

Environment:
  SAFEHOUSE_ADD_DIRS_RO
      Colon-separated read-only paths (same format as --add-dirs-ro)

  SAFEHOUSE_ADD_DIRS
      Colon-separated read/write paths (same format as --add-dirs)

  SAFEHOUSE_WORKDIR
      Workdir override (same behavior as --workdir, including empty string)

Config file:
  <workdir>/.safehouse (optional, auto-loaded if present)
      Supports keys:
        add-dirs-ro=PATHS
        add-dirs=PATHS
